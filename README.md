# Retroattract
Scripts to have Attract_mode the front end to Retrosmc instead of emulationstation


This is an alpha release right now. So I am not responsible for anything you do with this to your system. I am also very much a Noob. 




Disclaimer and other useful information. Read before installing!

First things first: I am NOT responsible if this does any harm to your system! I suggest only to install this on a system that the old installer wasn't run on already. You should have at least 2 GB of free space on your SD card.

Please report bugs and don't expect everything to work.  There are a few things I need to work out how to fix (The swap from KODI to Retropie isn't as smooth as I'd like. 



This will only work on a Raspberry Pi 1, 2 or 3  NOT on the Vero.
Installation

You will need to find your own Roms, artwork etc. 

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PiDiaries/Retroattract/master/install-attract.sh

chmod +x install-attract.sh

./install-attract.sh

 Install Retrosmc first and use Binaries. Then Attarct, it will compile itself so go get pizza.  
 Set the controllers up in Emulationstation first for Libretro Emulators.  Then have fun configuring Attract-Mode. 

2/5/16 
Added the option to install some Emulator Configurations for Attract-Mode.  These should cover all the standard RetroPie Libretro Emulators that use the retroarch.cfg.  So no experimental emulators etc.  To save space Mame & FBA use the same folders in the Arcade directory for Artwork. 




WARNING.  I don't have roms for all systems so I couldn't test them all. So some of the rarer systems might need tweaked. 

I've also added some of the folders that are on Floobs image for Artwork.
