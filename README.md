# Retroattract
Scripts to have Attract_mode the front end to Retrosmc instead of emulationstation


This is an alpha release right now. So I am not responsible for anything you do with this to your system. I am also very much a Noob. 


Disclaimer and other useful information. Read before installing!

First things first: I am NOT responsible if this does any harm to your system! I suggest only to install this on a system that the old installer wasn't run on already. You should have at least 2 GB of free space on your SD card.

Please report bugs and don't expect everything to work.  There are a few things I need to work out how to fix (The swap from KODI to Retropie isn't as smooth as I'd like. 

I haven't tested it from Github yet. 

This will only work on a Raspberry Pi 1 or 2! NOT on the Vero.
Installation

You will need to find your own Roms, artwork etc.
